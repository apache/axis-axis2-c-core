This sample demonstrate the Dynamic Invocation capabilities of Axis2 C.
It should be noted that to run this sample you should have configured
Axis2 C with the configure option --enable-wsdl-pull=yes.
To do this you should have installed WsdlPull and Axis2c_wsdl4c which
is a C wrapper for WsdlPull.
However in the WsdlPull version I used(version 1.9) I noticed that,  WsdlParser::getService() 
method is there in the Header file but not implemented. I sent a mail to WsdlPull yahoo group
asking to rectify this, so I hope that this problem will not be there in future versions.
However for the time being Please add the following code to WsdlParser.cpp

const Service *
WsdlParser::getService()
{
    if (element_ != SERVICE)
    {
         error ("Attempted to extract a Service when ,no service was parsed",1);
         return 0;
    }
    else
    {
        return services_.back();
    }
}

Also there is another fix for WsdlPull
In WsdlParser.cpp's parseService method

Add the following two lines
    if ("name" == xParser_->getAttributeName(i) &&
                (xParser_->getAttributePrefix(i)).empty())
        portName = xParser_->getAttributeValue(i);

after following code

for (i = 0; i < num_att; i++) {
    if ("binding" == xParser_->getAttributeName(i) &&
                (xParser_->getAttributePrefix(i)).empty())
        bnName = xParser_->getAttributeValue(i);
