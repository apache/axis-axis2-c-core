How to Configure IIS Module for Axis2C
________________________________________

Use the Axis2/C VC project or makefile to build the component.

In this document it is assumed that the mod_axis2_IIS.dll is in the directory
c:\axis2c\lib\mod_axis2_IIS.dll and axis2c_home is c:\axis2c

Add the following key to the registry.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Apache Axis2c\IIS ISAPI Redirector

Add a string value with the name axis2c_home and a value of c:\axis2c

Add a string value with the name log_file and a value of c:\axis2c\logs\axis2.log

Add a string value with the name log_level. The value can be one of trace, error, info, critical, debug, warning

IIS 5.1 or Below

Using the IIS management console, add a new virtual directory to your IIS/PWS Web site.
The name of the virtual directory must be axis2. Its physical path should be the directory
where you placed mod_axis2_IIS.dll (in our example it is c:\axis2c\lib). When creating this new
virtual directory, assign execute access to it.

By Using the IIS management console, add mod_axis2_IIS.dll as a filter in your IIS/PWS web site and restart the IIS admin service.

 
IIS 6 & 7

Using the IIS management console, add the mod_axis2_IIS.dll as a Wildcard Script Map.
    Executable should be the complete path to the mod_axis2_IIS.dll
    You can put any name as the name of the Wildcard Script Map

Please don't add the mod_axis2_IIS.dll as a filter to IIS as in the IIS 5.1 case.

Note: If the Axis2/C failed to load, verify that Axis2/C and its dependent DLLs are in the System Path (not the user path).
