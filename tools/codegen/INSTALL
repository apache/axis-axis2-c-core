Getting Axis2/C Codegen source working on Linux
=============================================
Build the source
This can be done using the following command sequence:
        ./configure --with-axis2_util=<axis2/util include path>  --with-axis2_woden=<woden include path>
        make
        make install
        use './configure --help' for options

NOTE: If you don't provide a --prefix configure option, it will by default
install into /usr/local/codegen directory.
