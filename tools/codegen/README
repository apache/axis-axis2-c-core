Apache Axis2/C Code Generation
=============================

Apache Axis2/C 2.0.0 includes a native C WSDL2C generator that eliminates the Java dependency
and provides faster, more reliable code generation for creating C stubs and skeletons from WSDL files.

Native C Generator
==================

The native C generator is a standalone tool that provides all the functionality previously
available through the Java-based tool, with improved performance and no external dependencies.

Prerequisites
-------------
- libxml2-dev package installed
- pkgconf package installed

Building the Native Generator
----------------------------
From the Axis2/C source directory:

	cd tools/codegen/native
	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake ..
	make

This creates the wsdl2c-native executable in the build directory.

Using the Native Generator
-------------------------
The native generator supports comprehensive command-line options:

	./wsdl2c-native -uri <WSDL_FILE> [options]

Command Line Options:
  -uri <path>          WSDL file path or URL (Required)
  -o <path>            Output directory (Default: current directory)
  -ss                  Generate server side code (skeletons)
  -sd                  Generate service descriptor (services.xml)
  -d <databinding>     Data binding: adb, none (Default: adb)
  -u                   Unwrap parameters
  -g                   Generate all classes (client and server)
  -a                   Generate async code only
  -s                   Generate sync code only (takes precedence over -a)
  -t                   Generate test cases
  -p <package>         Custom package name
  -l <language>        Language (only "c" supported)
  -h, --help           Show help
  -v, --version        Show version

Examples
--------

Generate a service skeleton in C:
	./wsdl2c-native -uri interoptestdoclitparameters.wsdl -ss -sd -d adb -u

Generate a client stub in C:
	./wsdl2c-native -uri interoptestdoclitparameters.wsdl -d adb -u

Generate with XML in/out model (no data binding):
	./wsdl2c-native -uri interoptestdoclitparameters.wsdl -d none

Migration from Java Tools
=========================

Previous versions of Axis2/C relied on Java-based WSDL2C tools. The native generator
provides the same functionality with these advantages:

- No Java runtime dependency
- Faster code generation
- Better error handling
- Consistent with Axis2/C philosophy
- Easier to maintain and debug

Simply replace any previous Java-based WSDL2C commands with the native generator.

Generated Code Compatibility
============================

The native generator produces code that is fully compatible with existing Axis2/C applications.
Generated stubs and skeletons maintain the same API and behavior as the previous Java-based tools.
