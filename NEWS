   3. Transports supported: HTTP
          * Inbuilt HTTP server called simple axis server
          * Apache2 httpd module called mod_axis2 for server side
          * IIS module for server side
          * Client transport with ability to enable SSL support
          * Basic HTTP Authentication
          * libcurl based client transport
   4. Module architecture, mechanism to extend the SOAP processing model
   5. WS-Addressing support, both the submission (2004/08) and final (2005/08) 
      versions, implemented as a module
   6. MTOM/XOP support
   7. AXIOM, an XML object model optimized for SOAP 1.1/1.2 messages; This has

   8. XML parser abstraction
          * Libxml2 wrapper
          * Guththila pull parser support
   9. Both directory based and archive based deployment models for deploying 
      services and modules
  10. Description hierarchy providing access to static data of Axis2/C runtime 
      (configuration, service groups, services, operations and messages)
  11. Context hierarchy providing access to dynamic Axis2/C runtime information
      (corresponding contexts to map to each level of description hierarchy)
  12. Message receiver abstraction
          * Inbuilt raw XML message receiver
  13. Code generation tool for stub and skeleton generation for a given WSDL 
      (based on Java tool)
