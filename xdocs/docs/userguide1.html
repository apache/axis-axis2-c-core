<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Welcome to Axis2/C, the Apache Axis2 implemented in C. This User's Guide
will help you to understand what Axis2/C has to offer and how to get started
with it.</p>

<h3><a name="What_is_Axis2_">What is Axis2/C?</a></h3>

<p>Axis2/C is an effort to implement the Axis2 architecture in C programming
language.</p>

<p>After months of continued discussion and coding in this direction, Axis2/C
now delivers the following key features:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Speed</strong> - Axis2/C uses
    its own XML object model and StAX (Streaming API for XML) parsing to
    achieve significant speed. In addition to that, Axis2/C is inherently
    benefited by the speed of its implementation language, namely C, compared
    to the Java implementation.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Low memory foot print</strong>-
    Axis2 architecture was designed ground-up keeping the low memory foot
    print in mind. Axis2/C strives to achieve the same with a well designed
    memory management strategy.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>AXIOM/C</strong> Axis2/C comes
    with its own light-weight object model for XML, AXIOM/C which is the C
    implementation of <a
    href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/0_93/OMTutorial.html">AXIOM</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>MEP Support</strong> - Support
    Message Exchange Patterns (MEP s) with in-built support for basic MEP s
    defined in WSDL 2.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Flexibility</strong> - The
    Axis2/C architecture gives the developer complete freedom to insert
    extensions into the engine (using modules and handlers) for custom SOAP
    header processing.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Transport Framework</strong> -
    We have a clean and simple abstraction for integrating and using
    transports and the core of the engine is completely
    transport-independent.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Composition and
    Extensibility</strong> - modules and phases improve support for
    composability and extensibility. Modules supports composability and is
    able to add support for new WS-* specifications in a simple and clean
    manner. They are however not hot deployable as they change the overall
    behavior of the system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Axis2/C team is working hard to continuously improve the implementation.
Please note that this is an open-source effort. If you feel you have some
time to spare, please get involved and lend us a hand! The Axis2/C developer
community welcomes your participation and contributions.</p>
