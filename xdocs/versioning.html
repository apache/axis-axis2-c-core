<h2>Versioning of Apache Axis2/C</h2>

<p>Apache Axis2/C contains both applications, like HTTPD, and libraries, like
APR. It also contains a number of related sub-projects. It allows third-party
service modules to be written against its API (such as HTTPD), and may also
compile its own third-party modules (e.g., mod_axis2) to be used with
HTTPD.</p>

<p>These complexities probably mean that we need to develop a fairly
comprehensive set of versioning rules.</p>

<p>Being an Apache project, the Axis2/C project follows the APR guidelines on
versioning. <a
