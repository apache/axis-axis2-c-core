APR. It also contains a number of related sub-projects. It allows third-party
service modules to be written against its API (such as HTTPD), and may also
compile its own third-party modules (e.g., mod_axis2) to be used with
HTTPD.</p><p>These complexities probably mean that we need to develop a fairly
comprehensive set of versioning rules.</p><p>Being an Apache project, the Axis2/C project follows the APR guidelines on
versioning. <a href="http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html" class="externalLink" title="External Link">http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html</a></p><p></p></div></div></div><div class="clear"><hr></hr></div></body></html>
