<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Welcome to Axis2/C, the next generation of Apache Axis implemented
in C!!!
This User's Guide will help you to understand what Axis2/C has to offer
and
how to get started with it. We hope you will benefit from the power of
Axis2.</p>
<h3><a name="Attention">Attention</a></h3>
<p>This User's Guide is written based on the Axis2 Milestone version

<h3><a name="What_is_Axis2_">What is Axis2/C?</a></h3>
<p>Axis2/C is an effort to implement the Axis2 architecture in pure C.</p>
<p>After months of continued discussion and coding in this direction,
Axis2/C
now delivers the following key features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Speed</strong> - Axis2/C
uses
its own object model and StAX (Streaming API for XML) parsing to
achieve significant speed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Low memory foot print</strong>-
Axis2 was designed ground-up keeping the low memory foot print in mind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>AXIOM</strong> C- Axis2/C
comes with its own light-weight object model, AXIOM C which is a C
implementation of AXIOM Java.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>MEP Support</strong> - Now
comes handy with the flexibility to support Message Exchange Patterns
(MEP s) with in-built support for basic MEP s defined in WSDL 2.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Flexibility</strong> - The
Axis2 architecture gives the developer complete freedom to insert
extensions into the engine for custom header processing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Transport Framework</strong>
- We have a clean and simple abstraction for integrating and using
Transports and the core of the engine is completely
transport-independent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>WSDL support</strong> -
Axis2 supports the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl" target="_blank">Web
Service Description Language</a>, version 1.1 and 2.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Composition and Extensibility</strong>
- modules and phases improve support for composability and
extensibility. Modules supports composability and is able to add
support for new WS-* specifications in a simple and clean manner. They
are however not hot deployable as they change the overall behavior of
the system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you enjoy using Axis2/C. Please note that this is an
open-source
effort. If you feel the code could use some new features or fixes,
please get
involved and lend us a hand! The Axis developer community welcomes your
participation.</p>
