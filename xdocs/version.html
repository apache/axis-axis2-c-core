<h2>Versioning of Apache Axis2/C</h2>
<p>Apache Axis2/C is contains both applications, like httpd, and libraries,
  like APR. It also contains a number of related sub-projects.  It
  allows for third-party service modules to be written against its
  API, like httpd.  And it may compile its own "third-party" modules
  (e.g., mod_axis2) for use with httpd.
</p>

<p>These complexities probably mean that we need to develop a fairly 
  comprehensive set of versioning rules.
</p>

<p>Being a Apache Project, Axis2/C project is to follow APR Guidelines on
  Versioning. <a
