PHP binding on Linux
====================

To get the PHP binding working on Linux, please follow the steps given below.

BTW this was tested with php-5.1.1 and php-5.0.4; they both worked.

AXIS2C_HOME=where/your/axis2c/code/is/located
PHP_HOME=where/your/php/code/is/located

1. Set AXIS2C_HOME env variable to point to where the Axis2C source is
2. Build Axis2C source by running $AXIS2C_HOME/build.sh
   NOTE: you need versions later than autoconf  2.59 and automake 1.9.5 on your PATH to build Axis2C source
3. Copy the AXIS2C_HOME/bindings/php/axis2 to PHP_HOME/ext
4. cd to PHP_HOME and execute the following sequence of commands
   NOTE: you need autoconf 2.13 and automake 1.5 on your PATH to build PHP source
       ./buildconf --force
       ./configure --with-axis2
       make
5. cd to PHP_HOME/ext/axis2/tests and run the following commands to see how PHP works with AXIOM
   ../../../sapi/cli/php build_programatically.php
   ../../../sapi/cli/php build_from_file.php


You can have a look into the PHP scripts to see how the OM API is used in PHP.
