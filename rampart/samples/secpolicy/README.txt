The scenarios available here can be deployed using either deploy.sh(UNIX) or
deploy.bat(WIN32).

Simply give the scenario name and username (The logged user) as an argument to the script
e.g. %sh deploy.sh scenario1 username

Each scenario has a README file describing it's purpose.

Make sure you have run the deploy_client_repo.sh by giving the first argument
as the username.

These scenarios will only copy the security policy xml files. To run the
client use the script samples/client/sec_echo/update_n_run.sh or
samples/client/sec_echo/update_n_run.bat
