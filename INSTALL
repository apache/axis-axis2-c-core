The release comes in two forms, source and binary. Both works only on Linux platforms as of now. 
We are striving hard to make the next release work on Windows platform.

To get both the binary and source distribution, you need libxml2 from http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html
(NOTE: most systems has libxml2 by default)

Getting Axis2C working with the binary release on Linux.
========================================================
1. Extract the binary tar package to a folder. 
   Set AXIS2C_HOME environment variable pointing to the location where you have extracted Axis2C
        AXIS2C_HOME='/your_path_to_axis2c'
        export AXIS2C_HOME
2. Run the simple axis server:
        cd /your_path_to_axis2c/bin
        ./axis2_http_server
This will start the simple axis server on port 9090. To see the possible command line options run
        ./axis2_http_server -h
NOTE: If you run into shared lib problems, set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/your_path_to_axis2c/lib
3. Run the sample clients in a new shell
        cd /your_path_to_axis2c/bin/samples
        ./echo
This will invoke the echo service.
        ./math
This will invoke the math service.
To see the possible command line options for sample clients run them with '-h' option
NOTE: If you run into shared lib problems, set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/your_path_to_axis2c/lib

Getting Axis2C working with the source release on Linux.
========================================================
1. Extract the binary tar package to a folder. 
2. Set AXIS2C_HOME environment variable pointing to the location where you want to install Axis2C.
        AXIS2C_HOME='/your_desired_path_to_axis2c_installation'
        export AXIS2C_HOME
3. Then go to the folder where you extracted the source
        cd /your_path_to_axis2c_source
4. Set parser location
You need to set the following two environment variables to point to libxml2. 
        LIBXML2_INCLUDE
        LIBXML2_LIB
If you are using the default installation of libxml2, usually those are
LIBXML2_LIB=/usr/lib
LIBXML2_INCLUDE=/usr/include/libxml2

5. Build the source
This can be done using the following command sequence:
        autogen.sh
        ./configure
        make
        make install
use './configure --help' for options.
NOTE: you may wich to use './configure --prefix=$AXIS2C_HOME' to ensure AXIS2C_HOME and 
intall forlder are the same

To get the samples working, you also need to make and make install the samples.
        cd /your_path_to_axis2c_source/samples
        make
        make install

6. go to AXIS2C_HOME
        cd $AXIS2C_HOME
7. Set up sample service libs
        cp  /your_path_to_axis2c_source/deploy/axis2.xml .
        cp -r /your_path_to_axis2c_source/deploy/services .
        cp lib/libecho.so services/echo/
        cp lib/libmath.so services/math/
8. Start simple axis server
        cd $AXIS2C_HOME/bin
        ./axis2_http_server
This will start the simple axis server on port 9090. To see the posible command line options run:
        ./axis2_http_server -h
9. Run the sample clients in a new shell
        cd $AXIS2C_HOME/bin/samples
        ./echo
This will invoke the echo service.
        ./math
This will invoke the math service.
To see the possible command line options for sample clients run them with '-h' option


Hope you would enjoy this first working version of Axis2C soap engine :)
